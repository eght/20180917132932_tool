	based on the concept of swarm, is described to face the problem of
	classification of instances in multiclass databases. Three different
	fitness functions are taken into account, resulting in three versions
	being investigated. Their performance is contrasted on 13 typical
	test databases. The resulting best version is then compared against
	other nine classification techniques well known in literature. Results
	show the competitiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization. In particular,
	it turns out to be the best on 3 out of the 13 challenged problems.

  abstract    = {Abstract Parameter design is an engineering methodology intended as a cost-effective approach for improving the quality of products and processes. The assumption is that there are both controllable factors (control variables) and uncontrollable/difficult to control factors (noise variables) that operate on the quality characteristic of a process. The goal of parameter design is to choose the levels of the control variables that optimize a defined quality characteristic while minimizing the variation imposed on the process via the noise variables. Parameter design was popularized in the mid 1980s by Japanese quality consultant Genichi Taguchi. A panel discussion edited by Nair summarized important responses to Taguchi's ideas and methodology. In the last decade, there have been many applications and new developments in this important area. This review paper focuses largely on the work done since 1992, but a historical perspective of parameter design is also given. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

                  model for the design of cellular manufacturing
                  systems (CMS). A recurring theme in research is a
                  piecemeal approach when formulating CMS models. In
                  this paper, the proposed model, to the best of the
                  authors knowledge, is the most comprehensive one to
                  date with a more integrated approach to CMS design,
                  where production planning and system reconfiguration
                  decisions are incorporated. Such a CMS model has not
                  been proposed before and it features the presence of
                  alternate process routings, operation sequence,
                  duplicate machines, machine capacity and lot
                  splitting. The developed model is a mixed integer
                  non-linear program. Linearization procedures are
                  proposed to convert it into a linearized mixed
                  integer programming formulation. Computational
                  results are presented by solving some numerical
                  examples, extracted from the existing literature,
                  with the linearized formulation. },

                  following features: (i) the majority of supply chain
                  cost parameters are considered; (ii) quantity
                  discounts to encourage the producer to order more
                  from the suppliers in one period, instead of
                  splitting the order into periodical small
                  quantities, are considered; (iii) the
                  interrelationship between lead time and
                  transportation cost is considered, as well as that
                  between lead time and greenhouse gas emission level;
                  (iv) demand uncertainty is assumed to follow a
                  pre-specified distribution function; (v) shortages
                  are penalized by a general multiple breakpoint
                  function, to persuade producers to reduce backorders
                  as much as possible; (vi) some indicators of a green
                  supply chain, such as greenhouse gas emissions and
                  waste management are also incorporated into the
                  model. The proposed model is first a nonlinear mixed
                  integer programming which is converted into a linear
                  one by applying some theoretical and numerical
                  techniques. Due to the convexity of the model, the
                  local solution obtained from linear programming
                  solvers is also the global solution. Finally, a
                  numerical example is presented to demonstrate the
                  validity of the proposed model. },

  Abstract =     {Manufacturers need to satisfy consumer demands in
                  order to compete in the real world. This requires
                  the efficient operation of a supply chain
                  planning. In this research we consider a supply
                  chain including multiple suppliers, multiple
                  manufacturers and multiple customers, addressing a
                  multi-site, multi-period, multi-product aggregate
                  production planning (APP) problem under
                  uncertainty. First a new robust multi-objective
                  mixed integer nonlinear programming model is
                  proposed to deal with APP considering two
                  conflicting objectives simultaneously, as well as
                  the uncertain nature of the supply chain. Cost
                  parameters of the supply chain and demand
                  fluctuations are subject to uncertainty. Then the
                  problem transformed into a multi-objective linear
                  one. The first objective function aims to minimize
                  total losses of supply chain including production
                  cost, hiring, firing and training cost, raw material
                  and end product inventory holding cost,
                  transportation and shortage cost. The second
                  objective function considers customer satisfaction
                  through minimizing sum of the maximum amount of
                  shortages among the customersâ zones in all
                  periods. Working levels, workers productivity,
                  overtime, subcontracting, storage capacity and lead
                  time are also considered. Finally, the proposed
                  model is solved as a single-objective mixed integer
                  programming model applying the LP-metrics
                  method. The practicability of the proposed model is
                  demonstrated through its application in solving an
                  APP problem in an industrial case study. The results
                  indicate that the proposed model can provide a
                  promising approach to fulfill an efficient
                  production planning in a supply chain. },

                  multi-period Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) where
                  multiple capacitated vehicles distribute products
                  from multiple suppliers to a single plant to meet
                  the given demand of each product over a finite
                  planning horizon. The demand associated with each
                  product is assumed to be deterministic and time
                  varying. In this supply chain, the products are
                  assumed to be ready for collection at the supplier
                  site when the vehicle arrives. A transshipment
                  option is considered as a possible solution to
                  increase the performance of the supply chain and
                  shows the impact of this solution on the
                  environment. A green logistic issue is also
                  incorporated into the model by considering the
                  interrelationship between the transportation cost
                  and the greenhouse gas emission level. The proposed
                  model is a mixed-integer linear program and solved
                  by CPLEX. We provide a numerical study showing the
                  applicability of the model and underlining the
                  impact of the transshipment option on improved

  abstract = {The capability of fuzzy systems to solve different
                  kinds of problems has been demonstrated in several
                  previous investigations. Genetic fuzzy systems
                  (GFSs) hybridize the approximate reasoning method of
                  fuzzy systems with the learning capability of
                  evolutionary algorithms. The objective of this paper
                  is to design and analysis of various kinds of
                  genetic fuzzy systems to deal with intrusion
                  detection problem as a new real-world application
                  area which is not previously tackled with GFSs. The
                  resulted intrusion detection system would be capable
                  of detecting normal and abnormal behaviors in
                  computer networks. We have presented three kinds of
                  genetic fuzzy systems based on Michigan, Pittsburgh
                  and iterative rule learning (IRL) approaches to deal
                  with intrusion detection as a high-dimensional
                  classification problem. Experiments were performed
                  with DARPA data sets which have information on
                  computer networks, during normal and intrusive
                  behaviors. The paper presents some results and
                  compares the performance of different generated
                  fuzzy rule sets in detecting intrusion in a computer
                  network according to three different types of
                  genetic fuzzy systems. },

  Abstract =     {{In nature, almost every organism ages and has a
                  limited lifespan. Aging has been explored by
                  biologists to be an important mechanism for
                  maintaining diversity. In a social animal colony,
                  aging makes the old leader of the colony become
                  weak, providing opportunities for the other
                  individuals to challenge the leadership
                  position. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, this
                  paper transplants the aging mechanism to particle
                  swarm optimization (PSO) and proposes a PSO with an
                  aging leader and challengers (ALC-PSO). ALC-PSO is
                  designed to overcome the problem of premature
                  convergence without significantly impairing the
                  fast-converging feature of PSO. It is characterized
                  by assigning the leader of the swarm with a growing
                  age and a lifespan, and allowing the other
                  individuals to challenge the leadership when the
                  leader becomes aged. The lifespan of the leader is
                  adaptively tuned according to the leader's leading
                  power. If a leader shows strong leading power, it
                  lives longer to attract the swarm toward better
                  positions. Otherwise, if a leader fails to improve
                  the swarm and gets old, new particles emerge to
                  challenge and claim the leadership, which brings in
                  diversity. In this way, the concept ``aging{''} in
                  ALC-PSO actually serves as a challenging mechanism
                  for promoting a suitable leader to lead the
                  swarm. The algorithm is experimentally validated on
                  17 benchmark functions. Its high performance is
                  confirmed by comparing with eight popular PSO
                  variants.}},

                  to quality planning activities through the
                  integrated use of loss functions and orthogonal
                  arrays. in this tutoriial, we focus on the
                  improvement and implementation of certain of these
                  techniques in the simulation arena. the orthogonal
                  arrays advocated by taguchi are related to classical
                  experimental designs, which have played important
                  tactical roles in the exploration of simulation
                  model output and the construction of mathematical
                  metamodels for the simulation response
                  surface. however, the loss function and the
                  associated robust design philosophy provide fresh
                  insights into the process of optimizing or improving
                  the simulation's performance. we use examples to
                  illustrate concepts such as the simultaneous
                  treatment of variability and mean of performance
                  measures, strategies for achieving system
                  robustness, and implementation of noise
                  (uncontrollable variation) through factorial
                  designs.  We also discuss relationships to other
                  issues in designing and analyzing simulation
                  experiments, such as response surface metamodels and
                  variance reduction. the tutorial is meant for both
                  practitioners and researchers.  we assume a
                  knowledge base at the level of Chapter 11 and 12 of
                  simulation modeling and analysis (law and kelton,

  abstract = { The objective of the present investigation was to
                  optimize and develop quetiapine fumarate (QF) loaded
                  chitosan nanoparticles (QF-NP) by ionic gelation
                  method using Box-Behnken design. Three independent
                  variables viz., X1-Concentration of chitosan,
                  X2-Concentration of sodium tripolyphosphate and
                  X3-Volume of sodium tripolyphosphate were taken to
                  investigate their effect on dependent variables
                  (Y1-Size, Y2-PDI and Y3-\%EE).  Optimized formula of
                  QF-NP was selected from the design space which was
                  further evaluated for physicochemical,
                  morphological, solid state characterization, nasal
                  diffusion and in-vivo distribution for brain
                  targeting following non-invasive intranasal
                  administration.  The average particle size, PDI,
                  \%EE and nasal diffusion were found to be
                  131.08±7.45nm, 0.252±0.064, 89.93±3.85\% and
                  65.24±5.26\% respectively. Neither toxicity nor
                  structural damage on nasal mucosa was observed upon
                  histopathological examination. Significantly higher
                  brain/blood ratio and 2 folds higher nasal
                  bioavailability in brain with QF-NP in comparison to
                  drug solution following intranasal administration
                  revealed preferential nose to brain transport
                  bypassing blood-brain barrier and prolonged
                  retention of QF at site of action suggesting
                  superiority of chitosan as permeability enhancer.
                  Overall, the above finding shows promising results
                  in the area of developing non-invasive intranasal
                  route as an alternative to oral route for brain
                  delivery.  },

The first two statistical moments of the stochastic parameters including design variables are considered in conjunction with the second-order perturbation method for the approximation of mean value and variance of the structural response. In this framework, the sensitivities of the mean values and variances of the structural performance function with respect to the design variables are calculated for use in the optimization task. The robust design of structures is formulated as a multi-criteria optimization problem, in which both the expected value and the standard deviation of the objective function are to be minimized. The robustness of the feasibility is also taken into account by involving the variability of the structural response in the constraints. The two-criteria optimization problem is converted into a scalar one and is then solved by a gradient based optimization algorithm. To demonstrate the applicability of the presented method, numerical examples are given, involving static and dynamic response.},

  abstract = {Robust Design is an important method for improving product quality, manufacturability, and reliability at low cost. Taguchi's introduction of this method in 1980 to several major American industries resulted in significant quality improvement in product and manufacturing process design. While the robust design objective of making product performance insensitive to hard-to-control noise was recognized to be very important, many of the statistical methods proposed by Taguchi, such as the use of signal-to-noise ratios, orthogonal arrays, linear graphs, and accumulation analysis, have room for improvement. To popularize me use of robust design among engineers, it is essential to develop more effective, statistically efficient, and user-friendly tech niques and tools. This paper first summarizes the statistical methods for planning and analyzing robust design experiments originally proposed by Taguchi; then reviews newly developed statistical methods and identifies areas and problems where more research is needed. For planning experiments, we review a new experiment format, the combined array format, which can reduce the experiment size and allow greater flexibility for estimating effects which may be more important for physical reasons. We also discuss design strategies, alternative graphical tools and tables, and computer algorithms to help engineers plan more efficient experi ments. For analyzing experiments, we review a new modeling approach, die response model approach, which yields additional information about how control factor settings dampen the effects of individual noise factors; this helps engineers better under stand die physical mechanism of the product or process. We also discuss alternative variability measures for Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratios and develop methods for empirically determining the appropriate measure to use.},

  本文提出了一类设计，可以用来实现过程的稳健性。
  这些新设计在结构上和经典的中心复合设计类似，
  但是不同的是这些新设计是混合解析度的。
  即，这些新设计的信号因子至少是V解析度的，不可控因子至少是III解析度的。
  新设计归类为复合型混合解析度设计CMR。稳健设计的大小进行比较，
  结果显示，CMR设计比相对应的田口设计具有更强的竞争力或相似的竞争力。
  我们计算了这两类稳健设计CMR设计和田口设计的相应曲面模型，
  其中含有CMR设计的D效率和G效率。},

The goal in these studies is to analyze location and dispersion effects and optimize performance over a range of input-output values. Taguchi and others have proposed the so-called signal-to-noise ratio analysis for robust design with dynamic characteristics. We consider more general and flexible methods for analyzing location and dispersion effects from such studies and use three real applications to illustrate the methods. Two applications demonstrate the usefulness of functional regression techniques for location and dispersion analysis while the third illustrates a parametric analysis with two-stage modeling. Both a mean-variance analysis for random selection of noise settings as well as a control-by-noise interaction analysis for explicitly controlled noise factors are considered.},

The proposed functions have the extra flexibility of allowing the analyst to assign different priorities among the responses.

However, manufactured products are typically characterized by numerous quality characteristics. In this paper we present a general framework for the multivariate problem when data are collected from a combined array. Within the framework, a mean square error (MSE) criterion is utilized and a non-linear multiobjective programming problem based on the individual MSE functions of each response is proposed for quality improvement. We adapted a suitable non-linear optimization algorithm to solve the proposed formulation. The optimization method used in this paper generates a string of solutions, called Pareto optimal solutions, rather than a “one shot” optimum solution to make selections and evaluate the trade-offs. The paper also presents an example and comparative results in order to demonstrate the potentials of the proposed approach.},

Although several methods tackling this problem have been published, they have proven unable to effectively resolve the situation if a system has continuous control factors. This work proposes a data mining approach, consisting of four stages based on artificial neural networks (ANN), desirability functions, and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to resolve the problems of dynamic parameter design with multiple responses. An ANN is employed to build a system’s response function model. Desirability functions are used to evaluate the performance measures of multiple responses. A SA algorithm is applied to obtain the best factor settings through the response function model. By using the proposed approach, the obtained best factor settings can be any values within their upper and lower bounds so that the system’s multiple responses have the least sensitivity to noise factors along the magnitude of the signal factor. An example from the literature is illustrated to confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The generalization of methods in the usual data from a simple response system to the data from a signal-response system is a good approach.

As with many flexible regression models, they may be prone to distortion of the fitted function caused by values with high leverage at either extreme of the covariate distribution. Furthermore, fractional polynomial functions are not invariant to a change of origin of the covariate. A new approach, based on a preliminary, almost-linear transformation of a covariate, is proposed. The transformation is approximately linear within the bulk of the observations and tapers smoothly to a truncation of the extremes. It incorporates a predefined shift of the origin away from zero. Empirical studies show that this transformation is effective in reducing extreme leverages. In two real datasets, it is shown its use can result in more sensible final models.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models are widely used for longitudinal data analyses. Time-dependent covariates are often introduced to partially explain inter-individual variation. These covariates often have missing data, and the missingness may be nonignorable. Likelihood inference for NLME models with nonignorable missing data in time-varying covariates can be computationally very intensive and may even offer computational difficulties such as nonconvergence. We propose a computationally very efficient method for approximate likelihood inference. The method is illustrated using a real data example.},

  abstract = {A robust minimax approach for optimal investment decisions with imprecise return forecasts and risk estimations in financial portfolio management is considered. Single-period and multi-period mean–variance optimization models are extended to worst-case design with multiple rival risk estimations and return forecasts. In multi-period stochastic formulation of classical mean–variance portfolio optimization problem, an investor makes an investment decision based on expectations and/or scenarios up to some intermediate times prior to the horizon and, consequently, rebalances or restructures the portfolio. Multi-period portfolio optimization entails the construction of a scenario tree representing a discretized estimate of uncertainties and associated probabilities in future stages. It is well known that return forecasts and risk estimations are inherently inaccurate and there are different rival estimates, or scenario trees. Robust optimization models are presented and imprecise nature of moment forecasts to reduce the risk of making a decision based on the wrong scenario is addressed. The worst-case performance is guaranteed in view of all rival risk and return scenarios and will only improve when any scenario other than the worst-case is realized. The ex-ante performance of minimax models is tested using historical data and backtesting results are presented.},

But generally there are more than one quality characteristics in the process and the experimenter attempts to optimize all of them simultaneously. Since response variables are different in some properties such as scale, measurement unit, type of optimality and their preferences, there are different approaches in model building and optimization of MRS problems. This study propose a general framework in MRS problems according to some existing works and some types of related decision makers and attempts to aggregate all of characteristics in one approach. The proposed framework contains four non-desirability parts of bias, response variation, errors in predictions and separation from responses’ specific region. We demonstrate the proposed framework with two examples of the literature and the results has been discussed with comparing of mentioned existing works.},

Typically, regression models are constructed from the experimental data and interrogated in order to provide a point estimate of the independent variable settings predicted to optimize the response. Unfortunately, these point estimates are rarely accompanied with uncertainty intervals. Though classical frequentist confidence intervals can be constructed for unconstrained quadratic models, higher order, constrained or nonlinear models are often encountered in practice. Existing techniques for constructing uncertainty estimates in such situations have not been implemented widely, due in part to the need to set adjustable parameters or because of limited or difficult applicability to constrained or nonlinear problems. To address these limitations a Bayesian method of determining credible intervals for response surface optima was developed. The approach shows good coverage probabilities on two test problems, is straightforward to implement and is readily applicable to the kind of constrained and/or nonlinear problems that frequently appear in practice.},

The ethanol concentration and time were found to be the most significant factors (p<0.0001) for the extraction of all three saikosaponins. By using the desirability function approach, the optimum MAE conditions to obtain desirable extraction yields for all these saikosaponins simultaneously were found at the microwave power of 360–400W, ethanol concentration of 47–50%, temperature of 73–74°C and time of 5.8–6.0min.

However, the Taguchi method is unable to deal with dynamic multiresponse owing to increasing complexity of the product or design process. Although several alternative approaches have been presented to resolve this problem, they cannot effectively treat situations in which the control factors have continuous values. This study incorporates desirability functions into a hybrid neural network/genetic algorithm approach to optimize the parameter design of dynamic multiresponse with continuous values of parameters. The objective is to find the optimal combination of control factors to simultaneously maximize robustness of each response. The proposed approach is based on three stages which (1) use neural networks for constructing a response function model of a dynamic multiresponse system, (2) use exponential desirability functions for evaluating overall performance of a specific factor combination, and (3) use a genetic algorithm to optimize parameter design. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a simulated example. Analysis results reveal that the approach has higher performance than the traditional experimental design.},

  abstract = {The Taguchi parameter design method has been recognized as an important tool for improving the quality of a product or a process. However, the statistical methods and optimization procedures proposed by Taguchi have much room for improvement. For instance, the two-step procedure proposed by Taguchi may fail to identify an optimum design condition if an adjustment parameter does not exist, the optimal setting of a design parameter is determined only among the levels included in the parameter design experiment, and, for the dynamic parameter design, the signal parameter is assumed to follow a uniform rather than a general distribution. This paper develops an artificial neural network based dynamic parameter design approach to overcome the shortcomings of the Taguchi and existing alternative approaches. First, an artificial neural network is trained to map the relationship between the characteristic, design, noise and signal parameters. Second, Latin hypercube samples of the signal and noise parameters are obtained and used to estimate the slope between the signal parameter and characteristic as well as the variance of the characteristic at each set of design parameter settings. Then, the dynamic parameter design problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem and solved to find the optimal settings of the design parameters using sequential quadratic programming. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example.},

比较多，上交、华科、 武大都考得是运筹学； 中南和川大 好像也是；运筹学是经济各类学科中中最“硬”的学科。当然也是最难准备的。运筹学本来就是数学的一个分支，当然多运用于经济，管理，军事上。 硬度很高。

我知道的有：天大，东北大学，哈工大，四川大学，北京理工大学，南开大学，华中科技大学，中南大学……大多数学校都是考运筹学的，要不就加其他的科目，比如上海交大（运筹学+概率论），南京大学和中科大（+管理学）
还有如果你想知道其他学校考什么东西，进他们的研究生院查看，这样信息也绝对准确

 　　►专业课复习方法

 　　►管理学

 　　给学弟学妹们分享一下专业课的复习方法吧，今年的专业课比较难，而且北邮压分，管理学是靠背，会背就会写，周三多的第二版知识点就够用了，当然也可以买五版或六版，都是那些知识点，把王梦宇总结的讲义会背，历年的真题也都跑不了，管理学基本就没问题了。

 　　►运筹学

 　　再说运筹学,运筹学今年的题出的风格挺不一样的，比较难，往年会有一两道原题，连数都不变,我把03-16的题和答案都吃透了，今年一道原题也没出，运筹学有把握的也就两道题，好，还是说说怎么复习吧，把课本看透，重视基础，有时间可以找些习题练练手，参考书就是北邮出版的运筹学和清华胡运权版本的运筹学，有能力有时间的可以买清华的运筹学习题集，不过没有参考答案，我是主要把书看懂看透后，做了三四遍真题，运筹学还是看个人情况，本科学过的话更好，运筹看懂学会了就容易，解题方法都是固定的，就是步骤繁琐，细心就好。

 　　希望学弟学妹们持之以恒，记住好的学习方法和高效的学习方式是最重要的。},

考研是一场信息战，离18年考研结束快半年了，我在这篇经验贴中将详细描述我所知道的中科大管理学院管理科学与工程专业(附带的说一下工商管理、物流)今年的情况和近几年的情况，供2019年备考的学弟学妹参考一下。
 
先做个概要性的说明吧，中科大管科的报考性价比极高，因为太容易考了，基本上是985院校里面最最好考的了，考研这件事，真的是选择比努力更重要。如果你看到这篇经验贴，我觉得应该是你的幸运，至少中科大管科可以成为你一个最最稳的选择。
 
首先介绍一下我自己吧，我来自北方某中档985院校经管类，我的出身在今年报考科大管科的人里头应该算是不错了，当然里头还有一两个是中科大本科生。今年划的复试线是300分，对的，你没听错，就是300，这还是一个经管类专业，难以置信吧。而且我告诉你，今年管科、物流、工商都没有招满，管科和物流总共就26个人进复试，也就是说300分，全部都录取了，一个都没有刷。在参加复试前，我联系了管院的杨锋老师，他是管理学院的副院长，他当时就说他已经和院里负责招生的老师说了，尽量让大家全部都录取，所以我在参加复试的时候是很放松的。告诉大家，中科大管理学院很友善，历年也基本上不怎么刷人，2017届也是只要进了复试就全部录取(我问了实验室的师姐了)，最最差的情况就是把报考管科的学生调剂到读物流，物流专业是专硕，名额很灵活，所以只要你过了复试线就一定可以录取。那么学弟学妹们比较关心的另一个问题就是考试内容，在这里我重点回忆一下科大管科的初试科目和复试科目吧。
 
中科大管科初试专业课是863管理科学综合，考管理学、统计学和运筹学。这是2018年刚刚改革的，听上去挺唬人的，考三门，每一门卷面分值50分。其实不要慌，管理学和统计学考的真的很浅，感觉都是送分的，运筹学考的难一点，但是有套路。今年管理学的50分感觉就像是答语文卷子，虽然指定了《管理学精要：国际化视角》是考试参考教材，但是不考死记硬背，全是理解式的答题，没有固定的答案，所以19级的学弟学妹在复习的时候没必要死记硬背，把书的每一章总结下框架，理解下就好。统计学指定的教材是中国人大出版的《统计学》，在看这本书的时候，我头都大了，公式特别多，很难记，但是公式之间是有明显的记忆规律的，通过类比记忆，不难的。我当时的办法就是列出每一种情景，然后相应的列出参数估计，假设检验，这样就比较好记忆。但是今年的统计学部分考的也超简单，复杂的公式都没敢考，里面的假设检验就只考了一个单正态假设检验，感觉命题水平和大学期末考试的卷子差不多吧，真的说得很客观，确实考的简单。最后就说一下运筹学吧，命题老师基本上是靠运筹学这50分来区分学生水平的，题目分为两部分，第一部分是5道名词解释共20分，比如动态规划的无后效性。第二部分是有些难度的，共30分，两道运筹学建模题，第一道题是飞机载客超额售票的题，需要套着排队论里面的模型来解答。第二道题是考动态规划的，有点复杂，我记不起来了。但是可以告诉学弟学妹们一个至关重要的信息，这两道题全是胡运权编写的《运筹学习题集》(封面是蓝色)里面的排队论部分和动态规划部分的原题，是原题!考上了之后，我和研一的一位师兄交流了一下，他是合工大的，他说去年的运筹学建模题也是在那本习题集里面找的原题，有些建模题很难，他实在不会就把答案全都记下来，要是在考场上碰到了就直接誊上去，因为他们学校前面几届考上去的本校前辈都说运筹学基本就是在那本书里择题出来考。所以19级学弟学妹们你们知道怎么办了吧，哈哈，备考资料就是胡运权的两本书，《运筹学教程》和《运筹学习题集》，教材上面的习题就不用做了，只需要把那本习题集啃下来就好。
 
再来说一下复试，前面已经和大家说了，中科大管理学院复试基本上不刷人，然后学院的复试内容也是刚刚改革了，先把官网上的考查项贴出来。（1）英语写作50分；（2）Matlab编程（手写代码）50分；（3）专业基础知识50分；（4）专业前沿文献阅读理解50分。面试成绩：满分100分。
 
这四项是在一张卷子里，3个小时考完，不要太紧张，题目得区分度不大，招生的老师说了，这其实是中科大夏令营里面的题目的简化版，值得一提的是matlab编程部分，大家不要怕，考得太简单了，就是考察最最基础的东西，根本就不算是编程，比如里面有一道题是画正弦函数的图像(10分)，还有一道题是给你一个一元二次方程，让你解出来它的两个解。这都是一两行代码就可以轻松搞定的问题，在任何一本matlab基础教材都可以找得到答案，不需要大家去复习数据结构这类的，说句实话吧，最难的题连冒泡排序的难度都达不到，用张宇说的话说就完完全全是paper tiger!
 
最后来说一说生源的问题，科大保研的生源还是不错的，985、211是主流。至于考研的生源，由于科大招生宣传不够，又加上身处合肥，实在是很无奈，现在大家都喜欢去北上广深等东部沿海地区，导致报考的人里头很多是本省的生源，安徽除了合工大和安大，也没啥211院校了，所以生源状况就不是那么好了。所以特别欢迎985、211院校的本科生来考中科大管科，比南京大学好考很多，也比华科武大等一路985要好考很多，经管类本来就分高竞争激烈，如果可以稳一点就没必要二战了，科大这边的导师还是非常喜欢出身好一点的本科生，出身好的话可以获得更好的资源(比如说成为牛导的弟子)，而且中科大的管理科学与工程也是非常不错的，在第四轮学科评估中获得A-，而且如果想要继续深造在国内外院校读博的话，中科大会是一个很好的跳板，毕竟是华东五校，比普通985还是好很多。
 
最后补充一下，中科大管科每一年招收统考的学生大概在25人左右，从科大本科生历届转专业的情况来看，管院是中科大第三受欢迎的院系，仅次于计算机学院和信息学院。科大管理学院在科研和出国等硬性指标生都比南京大学商学院强，和华盛顿大学、香港城市大学等国际院校都有联培，近些年管科的研究方向非常新，包括智能决策、智能制造、金融智能、市场智能、智能信息处理，这是科大在部署管理学与大数据交叉发展，可以做偏金融大数据方向的研究，也可以偏计算机技术、人工智能方向，真的都非常好了，如果不想读博士，就业的话和你在合肥，到南京上海杭州苏州武汉都在3个小时的动车之内，也很方便了。
 
最后欢迎2019级学弟学妹们报考中科大管理学院，学院的老师说18年是改革了，后面几年不会出现大的变动了，所以安心复习吧，18年因为9月份考试科目突然大改，所以很多人都不敢报考了，19年竞争一定会激烈很多，但是科大管院依然是很好考的，可以参考下今六年的初试线就知道，报考人数是不会突变的。考研是个很艰辛的过程，心理和身体的双重考验，但请坚持下去，天道酬勤，永远相信自己可以做到，把这一关撑过去就好了。我在考研帮论坛上的ID是PrinceUSTC，有什么不明白的可以问我。
 
我在科大等你们～},

Although the theory of robust convex optimization has taken significant strides over the past decade, all approaches fail if the underlying cost function is not explicitly given; it is even worse if the cost function is nonconvex. In this work, we present a robust optimization method that is suited for unconstrained problems with a nonconvex cost function as well as for problems based on simulations, such as large partial differential equations (PDE) solver, response surface, and Kriging metamodels. Moreover, this technique can be employed for most real-world problems because it operates directly on the response surface and does not assume any specific structure of the problem. We present this algorithm along with the application to an actual engineering problem in electromagnetic multiple scattering of aperiodically arranged dielectrics, relevant to nanophotonic design. The corresponding objective function is highly nonconvex and resides in a 100-dimensional design space. Starting from an “optimized” design, we report a robust solution with a significantly lower worst-case cost, while maintaining optimality. We further generalize this algorithm to address a nonconvex optimization problem under both implementation errors and parameter uncertainties. },

The paper surveys the main results of RO as applied to uncertain linear, conic quadratic and semidefinite programming. For these cases, computationally tractable robust counterparts of uncertain problems are explicitly obtained, or good approximations of these counterparts are proposed, making RO a useful tool for real-world applications. We discuss some of these applications, specifically: antenna design, truss topology design and stability analysis/synthesis in uncertain dynamic systems. We also describe a case study of 90 LPs from the NETLIB collection. The study reveals that the feasibility properties of the usual solutions of real world LPs can be severely affected by small perturbations of the data and that the RO methodology can be successfully used to overcome this phenomenon.},

Strategies for the design and analysis of experiments are discussed. The approach is illustrated using an example on gold plating.},

  title     = {Robust Parameter Design: A Semi-Parametric Approach},
  abstract  = {Parameter design or robust parameter design (RPD) is an engineering methodology intended as a cost-effective approach for improving the quality of products and processes. The goal of parameter design is to choose the levels of the control variables that optimize a defined quality characteristic. An essential component of robust parameter design involves the assumption of well estimated models for the process mean and variance. Traditionally, the modeling of the mean and variance has been done parametrically. It is often the case, particularly when modeling the variance, that nonparametric techniques are more appropriate due to the nature of the curvature in the underlying function. Most response surface experiments involve sparse data. In sparse data situations with unusual curvature in the underlying function, nonparametric techniques often result in estimates with problematic variation whereas their parametric counterparts may result in estimates with problematic bias. We propose the use of semi-parametric modeling within the robust design setting, combining parametric and nonparametric functions to improve the quality of both mean and variance model estimation. The proposed method will be illustrated with an example and simulations.},

The objective is to find the optimal combination of control factors to simultaneously maximize the robustness of each response.

These experiments reveal the interaction of the noise sources with design or control factors usually allowing creation of products that are relatively immune to noise. Finding truly optimal settings for design factors depends on the noise in the lab being representative of the actual operating environment and assumes potential product users all see the same noise conditions. This paper shows how basic design solutions can be shaped when multiple populations see different noise conditions and when typical assumptions on noise sources are violated. 1},

  year      = {2008},
  abstract  = {It is critical to estimate control-by-noise interactions in robust parameter design. This can be achieved by using a cross array, which is a cross product of a design for control factors and another design for noise factors. However, the total run size of such arrays can be prohibitively large. To reduce the run size, single arrays are proposed in the literature, where a modified effect hierarchy principle is used for the optimal selection of the arrays. In this article, we argue that effect hierarchy is a property of the system and cannot be altered depending on the objective of an experiment. We propose a Bayesian approach to develop single arrays which incorporate the importance of control-by-noise interactions without altering the effect hierarchy. The approach is very general and places no restrictions on the number of runs or levels or type of factors or type of designs. A modified exchange algorithm is proposed for finding the optimal single arrays. We also explain how to design experiments with internal noise factors. The advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated using several examples.},

  abstract  = {Two new Bayesian approaches to Robust Parameter Design (RPD) are presented that recompute the optimal control factor settings based on on-line measurements of the noise factors. A dual response model approach to RPD is taken. The first method uses the posterior predictive density of the responses to determine the optimal control factor settings. A second method uses in addition the predictive density of the noise factors. The control factor settings obtained are thus robust not only against on-line variability of the noise factors but also against the uncertainty in the response model parameters. On-line controllable and off-line controllable factors are treated in an unified manner through a quadratic cost function. Both single and multiple response processes are considered and closed-form robust control laws are provided. Two simulation examples and an example taken from the literature are used to compare the proposed methods with existing RPD approaches that are based on similar models and cost functions. 1},

This feature makes SPSA attractive for robust parameter design problems where some factors affect the variance of the response(s) of interest.

WEB was adapted to C by Silvio Levy in 1987, and since then both Knuth and Levy have revised and enhanced the system in many ways, notably to support C++ and ANSI C. Thus CWEB combines TEX with two of today's most widely used professional programming languages.This book is the definitive user's guide and reference manual for the CWEB system. The CWEB software itself is freely available via anonymous ftp from labrea.stanford.edu on the Internet.},

We show how to address these multiple problems, even with sparse data, by deriving explicit functions for state transitions and state detection, and by combining a modicum of auxiliary information indicative of a female's reproductive state with a mild assumption about the relationship between detection rate and reproductive rate. We incorporate this likelihood function into a Bayesian framework to estimate reproductive rate for the threatened eastern stock of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Southeast Alaska, a population for which reproductive rate has never been estimated. Our methods relax previous assumptions of multistate mark-recapture models and facilitate inference from ecological systems where sampling effort is highly constrained.},

However, in practical design environments, designers have to make decisions in isolation due to organization barriers, time schedules and geographical constraints. This paper will propose a new approach for the multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems in non-cooperative environments based on gene expression programming (GEP) and Nash equilibrium in the game theory. In this approach, the GEP method is used as a surrogate to construct the approximate rational reaction sets (RRSs) in the Nash model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the design of a thin-walled pressure vessel and the hull form parameter design of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) ship. The results show that this approach can fully explore and provide the explicit functional relationship between the strategy of an isolated player and the control variables of the other players, thus able to obtain a better Nash equilibrium solution.},

  abstract = {Background
The receptive field (RF) represents the signal preferences of sensory neurons and is the primary analysis method for understanding sensory coding. While it is essential to estimate a neuron's RF, finding numerical solutions to increasingly complex RF models can become computationally intensive, in particular for high-dimensional stimuli or when many neurons are involved.
New method
Here we propose an optimization scheme based on stochastic approximations that facilitate this task. The basic idea is to derive solutions on a random subset rather than computing the full solution on the available data set. To test this, we applied different optimization schemes based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to both the generalized linear model (GLM) and a recently developed classification-based RF estimation approach.
Results and comparison with existing method
Using simulated and recorded responses, we demonstrate that RF parameter optimization based on state-of-the-art SGD algorithms produces robust estimates of the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). Results on recordings from the auditory midbrain demonstrate that stochastic approximations preserve both predictive power and tuning properties of STRFs. A correlation of 0.93 with the STRF derived from the full solution may be obtained in less than 10% of the full solution's estimation time. We also present an on-line algorithm that allows simultaneous monitoring of STRF properties of more than 30 neurons on a single computer.
Conclusions
The proposed approach may not only prove helpful for large-scale recordings but also provides a more comprehensive characterization of neural tuning in experiments than standard tuning curves.},

The availability of the system and the corresponding designing cost are considered as two optimization objectives. A crisp multiobjective optimization formulation is presented on the basis of uncertainty theory to solve this resultant problem. For solving this problem efficiently, a new multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed to search the Pareto efficient set, which introduces rank value and crowding distance in the greedy selection strategy, applies fast non-dominated sort procedure in the exploitation search and inserts tournament selection in the onlooker bee phase. It shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms NSGA-II greatly and can solve multiobjective redundancy allocation problem efficiently. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate this approach.},

A fuzzy multi-objective programming based approach is presented to solve the small and medium size problems to optimality. For larger problems, we propose two meta-heuristics based algorithms. Lower bounds, and several numerical examples with managerial insights are discussed. A real case-study is provided, and the existing and the proposed optimal solutions are compared.},

  abstract = {In engineering design, information regarding the uncertain variables or parameters is usually in the form of finite samples. Existing methods in optimal design under uncertainty cannot handle this form of incomplete information; they have to either discard some valuable information or postulate existence of additional information. In this article, we present a reliability-based optimization method that is applicable when information of the uncertain variables or parameters is in the form of both finite samples and probability distributions. The method adopts a Bayesian binomial inference technique to estimate reliability, and uses this estimate to maximize the confidence that the design will meet or exceed a target reliability. The method produces a set of Pareto trade-off designs instead of a single design, reflecting the levels of confidence about a design’s reliability given certain incomplete information. As a demonstration, we apply the method to design an optimal piston-ring/cylinder-liner assembly under surface roughness uncertainty.},

  abstract = {A work applied response surface methodology coupled with Box–Behnken design (RSM-BBD) has been developed to enhance styrene recovery from waste polystyrene (WPS) through pyrolysis. The relationship between styrene yield and three selected operating parameters (i.e., temperature, heating rate, and carrier gas flow rate) was investigated. A second order polynomial equation was successfully built to describe the process and predict styrene yield under the study conditions. The factors identified as statistically significant to styrene production were: temperature, with a quadratic effect; heating rate, with a linear effect; carrier gas flow rate, with a quadratic effect; interaction between temperature and carrier gas flow rate; and interaction between heating rate and carrier gas flow rate. The optimum conditions for the current system were determined to be at a temperature range of 470–505°C, a heating rate of 40°C/min, and a carrier gas flow rate range of 115–140mL/min. Under such conditions, 64.52% WPS was recovered as styrene, which was 12% more than the highest reported yield for reactors of similar size. It is concluded that RSM-BBD is an effective approach for yield optimization of styrene recovery from WPS pyrolysis.},

  abstract = {Multi-periodic inventory control problems are mainly studied by employing one of two assumptions. First, the continuous review, where depending on the inventory level, orders can happen at any time, and next the periodic review, where orders can only be placed at the beginning of each period. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and assume the times between two replenishments are independent random variables. For the problem at hand, the decision variables (the maximum inventory of several products) are of integer-type and there is a single space-constraint. While demands are treated as fuzzy numbers, a combination of back-order and lost-sales is considered for the shortages. We demonstrate the model of this problem is of an integer-nonlinear-programming type. A hybrid method of fuzzy simulation (FS) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this problem. The performance of the proposed method is then compared with the performance of an existing hybrid FS and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm through three numerical examples containing different numbers of products. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed methodology along with a sensitivity analysis on its parameters is shown by numerical examples. The comparison results show that, at least for the numerical examples under consideration, the hybrid method of FS and GA shows better performance than the hybrid method of FS and SA.},

  abstract = {For an effective and efficient application of machining processes it is often necessary to consider more than one machining performance characteristics for the selection of optimal machining parameters. This implies the need to formulate and solve multi-objective optimization problems. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend of using meta-heuristic algorithms for solving multi-objective machining optimization problems. Although having the ability to efficiently handle highly non-linear, multi-dimensional and multi-modal optimization problems, meta-heuristic algorithms are plagued by numerous limitations as a consequence of their stochastic nature. To overcome some of these limitations in the machining optimization domain, a software prototype for solving multi-objective machining optimization problems was developed. The core of the developed software prototype is an algorithm based on exhaustive iterative search which guarantees the optimality of a determined solution in a given discrete search space. This approach is justified by a continual increase in computing power and memory size in recent years. To analyze the developed software prototype applicability and performance, four case studies dealing with multi-objective optimization problems of non-conventional machining processes were considered. Case studies are selected to cover different formulations of multi-objective optimization problems: optimization of one objective function while all the other are converted into constraints, optimization of a utility function which combines all objective functions and determination of a set of Pareto optimal solutions. In each case study optimization solutions that had been determined by past researchers using meta-heuristic algorithms were improved by using the developed software prototype.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of designing robust observer-based adaptive fuzzy tracking control scheme for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with plant uncertainties, time delayed uncertainties, and external disturbances. A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions and an adaptive fuzzy observer is introduced for state estimations. The proposed control law is based on indirect adaptive fuzzy control and uses two on-line estimations. This allows for the simultaneous inclusion of identifying gains of the delayed state uncertainties and training of the weights of the fuzzy system by introducing estimated error vectors. The advantage of employing an adaptive fuzzy system is the use of linear analytical results instead of estimating nonlinear system functions with online update laws. The adaptive fuzzy tracking control using Variable Structure (VS) control technique is derived based on Lyapunov criterion and the Riccati-inequality to resolve system uncertainties, time delayed uncertainties, and external disturbances. This is done in such a way that all states of the system are bounded and the H∞ tracking performance is achieved. Finally, a two-connected inverted pendulums on carts system (Liu et al., 2011) [29] is used for simulation purposes and some comparisons are given to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this study, the time-averaged mixing index was used to estimate the mixing performance of time-dependent flow. From the results, it was found that the mixer with an oscillating stirrer was much more enhanced and stabilized. Therefore, an optimum design for an active micro-mixer with an oscillating stirrer was performed based on the Taguchi method in order to obtain a robust solution. The design parameters were selected as the reduced frequency, the length and the rotation angle of the stirrer, and the optimal values were determined as 2, 0.8D and ±75°, respectively. It was found that the mixing index of the optimal design was improved by up to 84.59% compared to that of the initial design.},

The authors not only break things down very simply but also give a full understanding of why each topic covered is essential to learning proper quality management. They present the information in a manner that builds a strong foundation in quality management without overwhelming readers. See what’s new in the new edition:   Reflects changes in the latest revision of the ISO 9000 Standards and the Baldrige Award criteria Includes new mini-projects and examples throughout Incorporates Lean methods for reducing cycle time, increasing throughput, and reducing waste Contains increased coverage of strategic planning  This text covers management and statistical methods of quality engineering in an integrative manner, unlike other books on the subject that focus primarily on one of the two areas of quality. The authors illustrate the use of quality methods with examples drawn from their consulting work, using a reader-friendly style that makes the material approachable and encourages self-study. They cover the must-know fundamentals of probability and statistics and make extensive use of computer software to illustrate the use of the computer in solving quality problems.  Reorganized to make the book suitable for self study, the second edition discusses how to design Total Quality System that works. With detailed coverage of the management and statistical tools needed to make the system perform well, the book provides a useful reference for professionals who need to implement quality systems in any environment and candidates preparing for the exams to qualify as a certified quality engineer (CQE).},

In order to systematically optimize the process with multiple productive objectives, this article develops a variant of tissue P system (TPS). Inspired by general tissue P systems, the special TPS has a tissue-like structure with several membranes. The key rules of each membrane are the communication rule and mutation rule. These characteristics contribute to the diversity of the population, the conquest of the multimodal of objective function, and the convergence of algorithm. The results of comparison with a popular algorithm—the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2(NSGA-2) illustrate that the new algorithm has satisfactory performance. Using the algorithm, this study maximizes synchronously several conflicting objectives, purities of different products, and productivity.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel hybrid system, integrating high temperature MCFC-GT (molten carbonate fuel cell-gas turbine) and ORC (organic Rankine cycle), which provides the possibility to achieve high electrical and exergetic efficiencies owing to the subsequent electrical power output in the bottoming cycle. After developing a mathematical model, comprehensive energetic, exergetic, economic and environmental evaluations (4E analysis) are performed and a multi-objective optimization method is utilized to find optimal solutions while considering the exergetic and economic objectives simultaneously. Two conflicting objectives including total exergetic efficiency and total cost rate of the system in multi-objective optimization are taken into account to build a set of Pareto optimal solutions. This optimum solution results in the exergetic efficiencies of 35.6%, 44.3%, and 54.9% for the fuel cell system, ORC cycle and the whole hybrid system respectively, while the total cost of the plant is 0.294 M€ per year. The study reveals that introducing the ORC bottoming cycle leads to about 5% improvement in the exergetic efficiency of the proposed plant. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of variation in economic parameters, the fuel unit cost and interest rate, on the Pareto optimal solutions.},

A simple way of designing robust horizontal axis wind turbine systems under realistic conditions is outlined with multiple design parameters (variables), multiple objectives, and multiple constraints simultaneously by using the traditional Taguchi method and its extensions. The performance of the turbines is predicted using the axial momentum theory and the blade element momentum theory. In the parameter design stage, the energy output of the turbine is maximized using the Taguchi method and an extended penalty-based Taguchi method is proposed to solve constrained parameter design problems. The results of the unconstrained and constrained parameter design problems, in terms of the objective function and constraints are compared. Using an appropriate set of tolerance settings of the parameters, the tolerance design problem is formulated so as to yield an economical design, while ensuring a minimal variability in the performance of the wind turbine. The resulting multi-objective tolerance design problem is solved using the traditional Taguchi method. The present work provides a simple and economical approach for the robust optimal design of horizontal axis wind turbines.},

  abstract = {The field of industrial ecology promotes the establishment of resource exchange networks in eco-industrial parks (EIPs) as an approach toward resource conservation. Previous studies have shown that full blown resource integration can be encouraged through the exchange of common utilities such as energy and water. Different approaches such as mathematical programming, pinch analysis and game theory have been used to identify the optimal network designs, which can simultaneously reduce the utilization of freshwater resources and the generation of wastewater streams. Since water exchange in an EIP involves multiple independently operating plants, information exchange between the participants is not completely transparent and multiple future scenarios are expected to happen as the fate and plans of other participants are not completely divulged. These future scenarios may bring about changes in the capacity or characteristic of industrial processes and may also involve the entry of additional companies and the closure of previously operating ones. Such aspects have not been fully addressed in previous studies. A robust optimization model is thus developed in this work to determine the optimal network design which can effectively operate in anticipation of multiple probable scenarios. Case studies are solved to demonstrate the capability of the model.},

Spectrum sensing unit in cognitive radio deals with the reliable detection of primary user’s signal. Cooperative spectrum sensing exploits the spatial diversity between cognitive radios to improve sensing accuracy. The selection of the weight assigned to each cognitive radio and the global decision threshold can be formulated as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem where probabilities of false alarm and detection are the two conflicting objectives. This paper uses evolutionary algorithms to solve this optimization problem in a multiobjective framework. The simulation results offered by different algorithms are assessed and compared using three performance metrics. This study shows that our approach which is based on the concept of cat swarm optimization outperforms other algorithms in terms of quality of nondominating solutions and efficient computation. A fuzzy logic based strategy is used to find out a compromise solution from the set of nondominated solutions. Different tests are carried out to assess the stability of the simulation results offered by the heuristic evolutionary algorithms. Finally the sensitivity analysis of different parameters is performed to demonstrate their impact on the overall performance of the system.},

The nuclear fuel management optimization problem selected for the study aims at arriving appropriate reference discharge burnup values for the two burnup zones of 220MWe Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) core. Two Genetic Algorithm methodologies namely, Penalty Functions based GA and Multi Objective GA are applied in this study. The study reveals, for the selected problem of PHWR fuel bundle burnup optimization, Multi Objective GA is more suitable than Penalty Functions based GA in the two aspects considered: by way of producing diverse feasible solutions and the convergence speed being better, i.e. it is capable of generating more number of feasible solutions, from earlier generations. It is observed that for the selected problem, the Multi Objective GA is 25.0% faster than Penalty Functions based GA with respect to CPU time, for generating 80% of the population with feasible solutions. When average computational time of fixed generations are considered, Penalty Functions based GA is 44.5% faster than Multi Objective GA. In the overall performance, the convergence speed of Multi Objective GA surpasses the computational time advantage of Penalty Functions based GA. The ability of Multi Objective GA in producing more diverse feasible solutions is a desired feature of the problem selected, that helps the reactor operator in getting more choices when deciding the appropriate discharge burnups of the core zones.},

extensively adopted in various industries to continuously improve product design in response to customer 
requirements. The dynamic system of the Taguchi method is frequently implemented to design products with 
flexible applications. However, Taguchi's dynamic system can be employed only for individual quality 
characteristic, and the relationship between the quality characteristic and the signal factor is assumed to 
be linear. Because of these restrictions, Taguchi's dynamic system is ineffective for multiple quality 
characteristics or when the quality characteristic has a nonlinear relationship with the signal factor. This 
study describes a novel procedure for optimizing a dynamic system based on data envelopment analysis. The 
proposed procedure overcomes the limitations of Taguchi's dynamic system. Two cases are analyzed to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. The results show that the proposed procedure can 
enhance multiple dynamic quality characteristics. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the multi-objective reliability redundancy allocation problem of a series system where the reliability of the system and the corresponding designing cost are considered as two different objectives. Due to non-stochastic uncertain and conflicting factors it is difficult to reduce the cost of the system and improve the reliability of the system simultaneously. In such situations, the decision making is difficult, and the presence of multi-objectives gives rise to multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP), which leads to Pareto optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution. However in order to make the model more flexible and adaptable to human decision process, the optimization model can be expressed as fuzzy nonlinear programming problems with fuzzy numbers. Thus in a fuzzy environment, a fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem (FMOOP) is formulated from the original crisp optimization problem. In order to solve the resultant problem, a crisp optimization problem is reformulated from FMOOP by taking into account the preference of decision maker regarding cost and reliability goals and then particle swarm optimization is applied to solve the resulting fuzzified MOOP under a number of constraints. The approach has been demonstrated through the case study of a pharmaceutical plant situated in the northern part of India.},

Friction stir welding between AA5052-H32 aluminium plates is performed by central composite design technique of response surface methodology. It is found that the welding parameters such as tool pin profile, tool rotational speed, welding speed, and tool tilt angle play a major role in deciding the joint characteristics. The joints fabricated using tapered square pin profile tool with a tool rotational speed of 600 r/min, welding speed of 65 mm/min, and tool tilt angle of 1.5° result in an unexpected weld efficiency of 93.51%. Mathematical models are developed to map the correlation between the parameters and responses (ultimate tensile strength and elongation) and these models are optimized to maximize the ultimate tensile strength of the friction stir welded joint. Response plots generated from the mathematical models are used to interpret the interaction effects of the welding parameters on the response variables. Adequacy of the developed models is validated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. Results from the confirmatory experiments plotted in scatter diagram show a good agreement with predicted models. Different grain structures in various zones of the weld are examined by observing the micro and macro structures of the weld.},

  abstract = {In this paper a method is presented for deriving the explicit robust model-based optimal control law for constrained linear dynamic systems. The controller is derived off-line via parametric programming before any actual process implementation takes place. The proposed control scheme guarantees feasible operation in the presence of bounded input uncertainties by (i) explicitly incorporating in the controller design stage a set of feasibility constraints and (ii) minimizing the nominal performance, or the expectation of the performance over the uncertainty space. An extension of the method to problems involving target point tracking in the presence of persistent disturbances is also discussed. The general concept is illustrated with two examples.},
